## TODO: 
1) Upload an image (artpiece)-> return a url for uploaded image
2) send image to split by color -> return urls for multiple images by color
3) perform iterations on each "layer"
4) combine iterations for each layer to produce multiple images -> return urls for each image



1. upload image (png/jpg, filled, not hollow) -> return url of image
2. image is worked into multiple 'layers' (diff colors) -> return url of each image layer
3. each 'base layer' is organized by folder (1 layer image per folder to start)
4. image in each folder is 'copied' and modified in variety of ways. -> return url for each modified layer
5. now have multiple folders with multiple image layers, generative script creates multiple images from each layer -> return urls for each image.
